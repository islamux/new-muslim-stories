Alessandro, a Brazilian taxi driver working at Sao Paulo mosque, was already Muslim and actively inviting others. One day, a man from Pernambuco (3000 km away) called the mosque, mistakenly thinking it was an "Arabic Church," but inquired sincerely about Islam.

## Moment of Guidance
Alessandro explained Islam's pillars, faith, and Allah over the phone. Three months later, the man traveled to Sao Paulo solely to say the Shahada; they spent the day (9 AM-5 PM) teaching him prayer, wudu, Al-Fatiha, and Ikhlas before he returned home.

## Reflections
Six months later, he called distressed about missing one Asr prayer while visiting his sick grandmother, showing perfect commitment. Alessandro was moved to tears; Sheikh Fahad contrasted this new Muslim's dedication with born Muslims' lapses. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPss3Y2LUjw)
