## My Life Before Islam

Before finding Islam, Yusuf Islam was known worldwide as Cat Stevens, one of the most successful singer-songwriters of the 1970s. With hits like "Wild World," "Peace Train," and "Morning Has Broken," he had achieved fame, wealth, and recognition that most artists only dream of. Yet, despite his commercial success and adoring fans, he felt a deep spiritual emptiness. He had everything the material world could offer, but his soul was searching for something deeper. This inner restlessness led him to question the purpose of life and the meaning behind his success.

## The Moment of Guidance

In December 1976, while swimming in the Pacific Ocean near Malibu, Yusuf was caught in a dangerous rip current. As he struggled to stay afloat, the powerful waves began pulling him further out to sea. Exhausted and realizing he might drown, he desperately cried out to God, making a solemn promise: "Oh God, if you save me, I will work for You."

Miraculously, a wave pushed him toward shore, and he was able to reach safety. This near-death experience became a turning point in his life. True to his promise, Yusuf began a spiritual journey to find God. His brother, David Gordon, who had recently returned from Jerusalem, gave him a copy of the Quran. As Yusuf began reading, he was deeply moved by its message. He was particularly struck by the story of the Prophet Joseph (Yusuf in Arabic), which resonated with his own experiences of betrayal and ultimate redemption. On December 23, 1977, he embraced Islam and took the name Yusuf Islam.

## Reflections

Yusuf Islam's conversion marked the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. He stepped away from the music industry that had made him a global icon, choosing instead to dedicate his life to his faith, family, and humanitarian work. Looking back on that fateful day in the ocean, Yusuf recognizes how a single moment of desperation became a moment of divine guidance. His journey from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes it takes losing everything to find what truly matters. Today, he continues to inspire others through his music, charity work, and unwavering commitment to his faith.
