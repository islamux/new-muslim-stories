### Life Before Islam

Hamza: The first time I heard something from the Quran was when I was working in a shop in Manchester, and my friend's sister came to visit and was trying to invite me to Islam. Honestly, I wasn't very interested at first. But she used to put the Quran in the shop, and I would hear verses from it.

### Moment of Guidance

One time, I heard a verse about Paradise and Hell, and it was very impactful. I felt something strange in my heart, and I started thinking about life, death, and what comes after. I began to research Islam more, and I read many books. In the end, I was convinced by Islam and declared my Shahada.

### Reflections

It was a long journey, but it was worth all the effort. Praise be to Allah for the blessing of Islam.
