### My Life Before Islam
I was an academic deeply immersed in the world of research at the prestigious University of São Paulo, specializing in Anthropology. For 16 years, I studied Islam strictly as a researcher and observer. I even produced four documentaries about Muslim life and values in Brazil and Africa long before I ever thought of converting. My life was characterized by constant anxiety and restlessness, despite a recurring dream I had since I was eleven years old. In that dream, I saw myself in a beautifully decorated palace, wearing a veil on my head. At the time, I never realized that the dream was a silent sign of the spiritual journey that awaited me.

### The Moment of Guidance
The turning point came while I was at home, listening to an Islamic nasheed while writing an academic article. I suddenly felt an overwhelming tightness in my chest, as if a voice within me was whispering: "The time has come." I didn't hesitate. I immediately reached out to Sheikh Jihad Hammadeh via Twitter and told him I was ready to testify my faith. I insisted on taking my Shahada right then and there through private messages before he boarded a flight. In that moment, I felt as though I had been born again. I chose the name "Aisha," inspired by Lady Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her), because of her immense scholarly status and her role as a symbol of female leadership and knowledge.

### Reflections
What amazed me most about the Quran was the command "Iqra" (Read/Proclaim). A religion that begins its very first revelation with an order to seek knowledge is a religion that profoundly respects the human mind. It is a universal call for both men and women. I realized that Islam is synonymous with "knowledge," which is why God elevates the status of those who learn. Today, after 16 years of searching, the greatest gift I have received is "Sabr" (patience) and tranquility. I have learned that while we must put in the effort, the ultimate outcome is always in the hands of the Creator. This certainty is what finally extinguished the fires of anxiety in my heart.
