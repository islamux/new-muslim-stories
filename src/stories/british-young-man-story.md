### Life Before Islam

Rahim Jung's mother, who had Irish heritage, was initially "vocally and passionately against religion" due to negative past experiences, including being excommunicated from the Catholic faith after a divorce. She viewed religious people as hypocrites.

### Moment of Guidance

Despite her strong aversion to religion, Rahim Jung consistently made supplications (dua) for his mother's guidance to Islam over many years, even when he felt it was impossible. The turning point came when his mother became ill with cancer. During her last days, Rahim Jung was often by her side in the hospital. He cautiously introduced the idea of a Creator and the concept of life as a journey, which resonated with her. He also shared what George Bernard Shaw had said about Prophet Muhammad, which she began to tell others about, slowly opening the door to the idea of Islam.

A significant moment occurred when his mother expressed her wish to be cremated, a common practice in her background. Rahim Jung, however, explained the Islamic burial process, emphasizing dignity and the swiftness of burial. She responded by saying, "That's what I want," and informed her other children of her change of heart, which surprised them given her known dislike for religion.

Although she had expressed a desire for a Muslim burial, she had not yet formally accepted Islam. Rahim Jung felt a dilemma, as he couldn't request a Muslim funeral for someone who wasn't Muslim. He continued to speak with her, subtly introducing Islamic concepts. In her very last moments, she gave the Shahada (the declaration of faith in Islam).

### Reflections

Rahim Jung describes his mother's acceptance of Islam as "the greatest miracle of my life." She was subsequently buried in a Muslim cemetery. This story highlights the power of persistent prayer and the profound impact of a sincere call to Islam, even in the face of deep-seated resistance.
