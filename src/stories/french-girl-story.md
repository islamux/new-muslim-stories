## Life Before Islam

Barbara, a young French woman, was raised Catholic but found many aspects of Catholicism illogical, which led her to leave it. She felt a deep need to search for the truth and began reading the Qur'an to understand it.

## Moment of Guidance

Upon her first reading of the Qur'an, she felt as if Allah was speaking to her directly, creating a beautiful and deeply emotional experience. She realized she was returning to Allah and began to feel herself as His devoted servant.

## Reflections

Despite her personal strength, she came to recognize her weakness before Allah and that her life had no meaning without Islam. Her story moved Sheikh Fahad Al-Kandari to tears, reflecting on the blessing of Islam and the responsibility of spreading it, while warning Muslims not to neglect dawah.
