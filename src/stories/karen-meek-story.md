Karen Meek, a 33-year-old from Lewisville, grew up with a skeptical view of religion. She considered it "ridiculous" and didn't believe in God. However, her perspective began to change when she encountered Islam.

### The Logic of Islam

Karen was drawn to the logic and clarity of Islamic teachings. She found that Islam provided a rational and coherent framework for understanding the world and our place in it. The more she learned, the more she found that she couldn't resist the compelling logic of the faith.

### A Journey of the Mind

For Karen, the journey to Islam was primarily an intellectual one. She spent a great deal of time reading and researching, and she was impressed by the consistency and coherence of the Quran. She found that Islam answered her questions in a way that no other religion or philosophy had been able to do.

### Reflections

Karen's story is a powerful reminder that the path to faith can be a journey of the mind as well as the heart. It shows that Islam can appeal to reason and logic, and that it can provide a compelling and satisfying worldview for those who are seeking the truth.
