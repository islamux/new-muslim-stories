### Life Before Islam
Daniel, a British man, grew up Christian but was not devout. He studied in Bath and at Bristol University, where he first encountered Islam through Muslim friends, though he found them not fully practicing, sparking his curiosity to explore the faith independently.

### Moment of Guidance
The Quran guided him, especially the verse in Surah Taha: "Your God is One God; there is no god except Him, encompassing all things in knowledge." This deeply moved him after the story of the Children of Israel and the worship of the calf. He pronounced the Shahada right after, feeling immediate peace.

### Reflections
Eight years into Islam, he earned an ijazah in Quran recitation with tajweed from Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al-Mahmoud in Britain, despite not understanding Arabic, and completed the full Quran three times. He negotiated with police employers for prayer time, his wife's hijab, and da'wah opportunities, emphasizing that the best invitation to Islam is through morals and example.
