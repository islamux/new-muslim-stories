### Life Before Islam

My name is Yusuf Estes, formerly Joseph Estes. I was born into a devout Christian family in the American Midwest. I was a music minister and a preacher. I hated Islam and Muslims, a religion and people I knew nothing about except for the distorted image I had. Despite achieving financial success, I lacked peace of mind, which can only be achieved by knowing the truth.

### Moment of Guidance

My story with Islam began in 1991 when I met an Egyptian Muslim for a business deal, whom I intended to convert to Christianity. We, along with my father, my wife, and another Catholic priest, all ended up living under one roof. We held nightly discussions about religion. I was struck by the fact that we Christians had many different versions of the Bible, while the Muslim, Mohamed, had only one Quran. I could never reconcile the concept of the Trinity. Mohamed's calm demeanor, his logical arguments, and especially his recitation of Surah Al-Ikhlas (The Purity) deeply affected me. After my priest friend converted to Islam, followed by my wife, I felt a strong pull. I prostrated on the ground and asked God to guide me. At that moment, I knew what I had to do. I declared my testimony of faith (Shahada).

### Reflections

My father also converted a few months later. I see the conversion of our entire household as a testament to the power of God and the good example of that one Muslim. Since then, I have dedicated my life to calling people to Islam and presenting its true, peaceful message to the world.
