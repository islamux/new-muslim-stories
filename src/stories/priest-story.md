## Life Before Islam
Yusuf Estes, originally a Christian preacher, was deeply involved in Christianity with his father, a preacher, and a Catholic priest friend. He sought truth about prophets, especially Jesus (Isa), and received a Quran as a gift from a Muslim friend, sparking his curiosity despite warnings against reading it.

## Moment of Guidance
A single verse—"Guide us to the straight path" (from Surah Al-Fatiha)—rang in his mind repeatedly. After his priest friend converted to Islam following mosque visits, Estes opened the Quran, felt its living words as if dawn-lit with fragrance, and embraced Islam immediately.

## Reflections
His first prostration sent shivers transforming his heart; he now dedicates his life to global da'wah, even at over 70, inviting strangers constantly and emphasizing heartfelt worship and spreading Islam as per the Prophet's call. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euy1-3MrPrw)
