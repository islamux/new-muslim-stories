## My Life Before Islam
I was always searching for the truth, constantly carrying a translation of the Holy Quran that I obtained from the Leeds University library. Everywhere I went, it was with me. I was watching for signs around me, waiting for guidance from God with sincerity and persistence for a long time. It was as if my heart was preparing for something, but I didn't know when or how that moment would arrive.

## The Moment of Guidance
One night, I was alone in my room when the power suddenly went out. I lit a candle to continue reading my translation of the Quran. As I was deeply absorbed in reading, the candle suddenly flipped and went out, leaving the room in pitch black. I was struck by a fear I had never felt before; I froze in place for a couple of minutes. Once I recovered, I relit the candle and looked at the book to find the liquid wax flowing over a specific page. I began to read the verse my eyes landed on: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day... are signs for a people who use reason."

## Reflections
That verse was the message I had been waiting for. Allah tells us that everything in the universe—from the creation of the heavens to the movement of the winds—is a clear sign for those who use their minds. To me, it wasn't just a verse; it was "the sign" that I could no longer ignore. I realized that guidance is not just a coincidence, but a call to reflect on the greatness of the Creator who surrounds us with His signs in every detail of our daily lives.
