## Reflections

Despite her personal strength, she came to recognize her weakness before Allah and that her life had no meaning without Islam. Her story moved Sheikh Fahad Al-Kandari to tears, reflecting on the blessing of Islam and the responsibility of spreading it, while warning Muslims not to neglect dawah.
