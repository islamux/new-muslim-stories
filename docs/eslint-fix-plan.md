# Plan to Resolve ESLint Configuration Issues

## 1. The Problem

Currently, the project's ESLint configuration is incompatible with ESLint v9, causing the `pnpm lint` command to fail. This is due to the use of a deprecated configuration format and results in errors like "Unknown options" and "Plugin not found."

## 2. The Solution

I will create a new `eslint.config.mjs` file that follows the modern "flat config" format. This will ensure compatibility with the latest versions of ESLint and Next.js, providing better error checking and a more maintainable setup.

### Key Changes:

- **Adopt Flat Config:** I will replace the old configuration with a new `eslint.config.mjs` file that exports an array of configuration objects. This is the new standard for ESLint.
- **Use `FlatCompat` for Next.js:** To ensure the Next.js-specific rules work correctly, I will use the `@eslint/eslintrc` `FlatCompat` utility. This allows us to continue using the official `eslint-config-next` package within the new flat config structure.
- **Simplify and Modernize:** The new configuration will be cleaner and more explicit, making it easier to understand and maintain in the future.

## 3. The Plan

1. **Create `docs/eslint-fix-plan.md`:** Create this markdown file to outline the plan.
2. **Wait for Approval:** I will wait for your approval before modifying any code.
3. **Implement the Fix:** Once approved, I will replace the content of `eslint.config.mjs` with the new, corrected configuration.
4. **Verify the Solution:** I will then run `pnpm exec eslint .` to confirm that the configuration is valid and that linting runs without errors.

This approach will resolve the immediate issue and align the project with current best practices for ESLint configuration in a Next.js project.
