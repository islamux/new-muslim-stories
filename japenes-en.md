## Life Before Islam
A young Japanese woman moved to Tokyo at 18, searching for Islam where there were no mosques or Muslims. She met an Indonesian Muslim woman working at a spice store who wore hijab and treated her with exceptional kindness, embodying Islamic ethics through actions rather than words.

## Moment of Guidance
When her Indonesian "mother" returned from Hajj, she offered her Zamzam water from Makkah. The woman wished for guidance to Islam before drinking it, then tears poured from her eyes, confirming her heart's transformation through this blessed experience.

## Reflections
She saw true Islam in the Indonesian woman's behavior and hospitality, fulfilling the Prophet's teaching about smiles and good manners. This personal encounter with Islamic character and Zamzam water led her to embrace Islam fully. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp1xU9xsdio)
