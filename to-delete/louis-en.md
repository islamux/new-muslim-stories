## Life Before Islam
Umair, a Brazilian ex-gangster, lived a "gore life" on the streets as a DJ and producer deeply addicted to drugs, selling them, and fully involved in crime. His tattoos symbolized street struggles, lost partners (tears), prison-like existence (mirror reflection), and gang affiliations from Mexico-inspired "thug life."

## Moment of Guidance
Living in constant danger heightened his faith instinctively, but realizing life's fragility prompted reflection. Exposure to Islamic materials from WhyIslam—free Quran, Prophet's history, dos/don'ts—reborn him, filling his heart with peace through Allah's remembrance as per Quran.

## Reflections
Islam freed him from clubs, alcohol, cigarettes, and cocaine; now steadfast, he aims to dawah street people, sharing peace they lack amid paranoia and clouded minds. He urges translating materials into Portuguese for Brazil's underserved, crediting WhyIslam's support. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13E5WG0VfPs)
