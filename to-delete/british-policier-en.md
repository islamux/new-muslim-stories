## My Life Before Islam

Daniel, a British police officer, was raised as a non-practicing Christian. He studied in Bath and at the University of Bristol, where he became acquainted with Islam through Muslim friends who were not fully practicing. This exposure sparked his curiosity and led him to read the Qur’an on his own.

## The Moment of Guidance

He was guided by the Qur’an, especially the verse from Surah Ta-Ha: *“Your God is only One God; there is no deity except Him. He has encompassed everything in knowledge.”* This came after reading the story of the Children of Israel and the worship of the calf. He immediately declared the Shahada and felt a profound inner peace.

## Reflections

After eight years, he obtained an ijazah in tajwid from a British shaykh despite not understanding Arabic, and he completed reading the Qur’an cover to cover three times. He stipulated that the police allow him time to pray, permit his wife to wear hijab, and allow him to engage in da‘wah. He emphasizes that the best form of da‘wah is good character.
