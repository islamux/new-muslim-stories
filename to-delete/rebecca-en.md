## Life Before Islam
Rebecca Hussain was born deaf in Bangladesh and moved to America at age three. Her parents discovered her complete deafness at school age; doctors confirmed no hope of hearing, viewing it as a test from God, so she learned sign language and married a hearing man, communicating through signs and limited speech.

## Moment of Guidance
Surah Al-Fatiha deeply impacted her first, opening hearts when taught in sign language to deaf people, evoking goosebumps and tears. Verses like Surah Ar-Rahman and Ikhlas further inspired her, filling her with warmth despite her inability to hear. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSvla3dAVZA)

## Reflections
She founded an organization for deaf Muslims, bringing nine people to Islam through sign language da'wah, emphasizing emotional expressions that move audiences. Despite challenges like no mosque interpreters, she learned to recite Quran, moved Sheikh Fahad to tears, highlighting able-bodied Muslims' greater responsibility.
