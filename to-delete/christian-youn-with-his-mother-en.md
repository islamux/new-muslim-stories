## Life Before Islam
Tim (now Jamal), a British Christian, converted to Islam privately but faced family tension, especially from his mother who didn't take it seriously initially. For 10 years, they had a difficult relationship as his family thought something was wrong with him. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dp2Nyts5U4)

## Moment of Guidance
Quranic verses guided him to Islam through Sheikh Fahad Al-Kandari's program, transforming his life completely. His public TV appearance discussing Islam marked a pivotal moment of commitment. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dp2Nyts5U4)

## Reflections
When his mother saw him on television speaking about Islam, she panicked, calling family saying "Tim is one of those fundamentalists." Now she's proud of him, relies on him for everything, and their relationship is healed through patience. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dp2Nyts5U4)
