## Life Before Islam
Lauren Booth was born in 1967 in North London to a model mother and actor father. She pursued acting, aiming for Hollywood, before retraining as a journalist in 1997, working for outlets like the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, BBC, Sky News, and Channel 5, hosting TV and radio shows.

## Moment of Guidance
In 2010, during Ramadan in Iran at a mosque shrine, after performing wudu and making dua for Palestine, she felt overwhelming peace like a "waterfall," erasing all worries, leading her to pray Fajr and realize Islam's truth. She took her Shahada soon after in a London mosque, describing it as monumental relief. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9OulQVYh8)

## Reflections
Family reacted with sarcasm and fear from her mother, concern over subservience from her father, but she improved family ties, reading Al-Fatiha to him on his deathbed. Media fired her from Sky News post-conversion; she now advocates via books like "In Search of a Holy Land," plays, and speeches emphasizing Islam's peace and nature's signs.
