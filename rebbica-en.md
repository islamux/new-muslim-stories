## My Life Before Islam

Rebecca Hussain was born deaf in Bangladesh and moved to the United States at the age of three. Her parents realized her complete disability and saw it as a divine test. She learned sign language and married a hearing man, but she struggled with the absence of Islamic education for the deaf.

## The Moment of Guidance

She was first deeply affected by Surah Al-Fatiha, which she uses in dawah through sign language, creating goosebumps and tears among the deaf. Surahs Ar-Rahman and Al-Ikhlas also filled her heart with warmth despite her inability to hear.

## Reflections

She founded an organization for the deaf, guided nine people to Islam through emotional sign language, and called for translators in mosques. She devoted effort to reciting the Qur’an despite the difficulty of pronunciation, moving Sheikh Fahad to tears and making him reflect on the blessings of Islam.
